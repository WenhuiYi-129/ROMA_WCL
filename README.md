## Abstract of Article
The rotary and movable antenna (ROMA) architecture represents a next-generation multi-antenna technology that enables flexible adjustment of antenna position and array rotation angles of the transceiver. In this letter, we propose a ROMA-aided multi-user MIMO communication system to enhance the efficiency and reliability of system transmissions fully. By deploying ROMA panels at both the transmitter and receiver sides, and jointly optimizing the three-dimensional (3D) rotation angles of each ROMA panel and the relative positions of antenna elements based on the spatial distribution of users and channel state information (CSI), we can achieve the objective of maximizing the average spectral efficiency (SE). Subsequently, we conduct a detailed analysis of the average SE performance of the system under the consideration of maximum ratio (MR) precoding. Due to the non-convexity of the optimization problem in the ROMA multi-user MIMO system, we propose an efficient
solution based on an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the AO-based ROMA architecture can significantly improve the average SE. Furthermore, the performance improvement becomes more pronounced as the movable region and the transmission power increase.
